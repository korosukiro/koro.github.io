# Ultra Instinct Goku

Son Goku adopts a unique transformation when using it. When the technique fully manifests,
Goku's eyes and hair become a distinctive silver coloration.
His hair remains raised slightly and his aura remains crystalline—though, in addition to blues and whites, 
it now sports purple and red hues as well and is noticeably brighter.
In the manga, the Hakaishin Beerus notes that any god would recognize this form as the technique Ultra Instinct.
This seems to be the case in the anime as well, 
as Whis and Beerus both recognize it and the Hakaishin from each universe stand to acknowledge Goku's achievement.
